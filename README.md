# vs-BowInLeftHand

A simple Mod to change the Bows to be rendered in the Left hand for Right handed peeps.
Credit for animations and concept go to Orangutanion, Shrewbloom, and Rodo.

Due to how the animation is patched, having a bow in the right hand will result in other player's (or Armorstands) holding both items in the left hand. Oopsie.
